The path_lookup(char *pathname, struct nameidata nd, int flags) function executes the following steps:

    1. Initializes some fields of the nd parameter as follows:
        a.  Sets the last_type field to LAST_ROOT (this is needed if the pathname is a
            slash or a sequence of slashes; see the later section “Parent Pathname
            Lookup”).
        b.  Sets the flags field to the value of the flags parameter
        c.  Sets the depth field to 0.
    2.  Acquires for reading the current->fs->lock read/write semaphore of the current
        process.
    3.  If the first character in the pathname is a slash ( / ), the lookup operation must
        start from the root directory of current: the function gets the addresses of the
        corresponding mounted filesystem object (current->fs->rootmnt) and dentry
        object (current->fs->root), increases their usage counters, and stores the
        addresses in nd->mnt and nd->dentry, respectively.
    4.  Otherwise, if the first character in the pathname is not a slash, the lookup opera-
        tion must start from the current working directory of current: the function gets
        the addresses of the corresponding mounted filesystem object (current->fs->
        pwdmnt) and dentry object (current->fs->pwd), increases their usage counters,
        and stores the addresses in nd->mnt and nd->dentry, respectively.
    5.  Releases the current->fs->lock read/write semaphore of the current process.
    6.  Sets the total_link_count field in the descriptor of the current process to 0 (see
        the later section “Lookup of Symbolic Links”).

    7.  Invokes the link_path_walk() function to take care of the undergoing lookup
        operation:
        return link_path_walk(name, nd);

We are now ready to describe the core of the pathname lookup operation, namely
the link_path_walk() function. It receives as its parameters a pointer name to the
pathname to be resolved and the address nd of a nameidata data structure.
To make things a bit easier, we first describe what link_path_walk( ) does when
LOOKUP_PARENT is not set and the pathname does not contain symbolic links (stan-
dard pathname lookup). Next, we discuss the case in which LOOKUP_PARENT is set: this
type of lookup is required when creating, deleting, or renaming a directory entry,
that is, during a parent pathname lookup. Finally, we explain how the function
resolves symbolic links.

Note: See link path walk.
